# Resuming Development Guide
Last Updated: 2024-12-29

## Current Development State

### Active Development
- Basic React setup with routing
- Core layout and navigation
- Placeholder feature components

### Temporarily Removed Features
- TypeScript
- Advanced UI components
- Complex form handling
- Advanced state management

## Starting a New Session

1. **Check Current State**
```bash
git status
git pull origin main
```

2. **Setup Development Environment**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

3. **Verify Setup**
- Navigate to http://localhost:3004 (or available port)
- Check navigation works
- Verify placeholder pages load

## Adding Back Features

1. TypeScript Integration
   - DO NOT merge old TypeScript files directly
   - Follow new type definitions from scratch
   - Implement types incrementally

2. UI Components
   - Start with basic components
   - Add Shadcn/ui components one at a time
   - Test each component individually

3. Form Handling
   - Implement basic forms first
   - Add React Hook Form gradually
   - Validate functionality before moving forward

## Common Issues

### Git Conflicts
- Always create new feature branch
- Don't merge old branches directly
- Consult team if conflicts arise

### Build Issues
- Start with clean npm install
- Check package.json matches current version
- Verify all dependencies installed

### Component Issues
- Follow new component structure
- Use placeholder components as templates
- Add features incrementally

## Development Workflow

1. Pick a feature from DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md
2. Create new feature branch
3. Implement basic functionality
4. Add types if applicable
5. Submit PR for review

## Next Steps
1. Implement client management
2. Add referral system
3. Restore assessment features
4. Integrate type safety
5. Enhance UI components

Remember: Build incrementally and test frequently!

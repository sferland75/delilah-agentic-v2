3. How do we want to structure the assessment workflow?

## Development Guidelines

### Git Workflow
1. Always start with:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   git status
   ```

2. Create feature branches:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/[descriptive-name]
   ```

3. Commit messages should be clear:
   - feat: (new feature)
   - fix: (bug fix)
   - docs: (documentation)
   - style: (formatting)
   - refactor: (restructuring)

### Documentation
1. Update this file at the start/end of each session
2. Document any major decisions or changes
3. Keep READMEs current
4. Update API documentation as needed

### Code Organization
1. Frontend
   - Components in `/frontend/src/components`
   - Types in `/frontend/src/types`
   - Services in `/frontend/src/services`

2. Backend
   - Agents in `/agents`
   - API routes in `/api`
   - Database models in `/database`

### Testing
1. Frontend
   - Run `npm test` before commits
   - Update test cases for new features

2. Backend
   - Run pytest before commits
   - Maintain test coverage

### Environment
1. Python
   - Use virtual environment
   - Keep requirements.txt updated

2. Node/React
   - Run `npm install` after pulls
   - Check for dependency updates

# Development Status - December 29, 2024

## Current Status
We are building a React-based frontend for the Delilah Agentic OT Assessment system. The basic structure is in place but there are some immediate TypeScript compilation errors that need to be resolved.

### Current Build Errors
1. Import path errors for types and services:
   ```typescript
   // Cannot find module '../../types/assessment'
   // Cannot find module '../../services/assessmentService'
   ```

2. Type mismatch in AssessmentForm:
   ```typescript
   // Type '"initial"' is not assignable to type 'AssessmentType'
   ```

### Component Structure
- `/src/components/assessment/` - Main assessment components
- `/src/components/clients/` - Client-related components
- `/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/src/services/` - API service layers

### Immediate Tasks
1. Fix Type Import Issues:
   - Verify tsconfig.json path mappings
   - Ensure type definitions are being built correctly
   - Check file paths in import statements

2. Fix AssessmentForm Type:
   ```typescript
   // Change from:
   assessmentType: 'initial',
   // To:
   assessmentType: AssessmentType.INITIAL,
   ```

3. Service Path Resolution:
   - Verify services directory structure
   - Update import paths for services

### Next Development Steps
1. Complete Core Components:
   - ✅ Assessment Form structure
   - ⏳ Assessment Edit functionality
   - ⏳ Assessment View component
   - ⏳ Assessment List with filters

2. Implement Data Management:
   - ⏳ API integration
   - ⏳ Error handling
   - ⏳ Loading states
   - ⏳ Form validation

3. Additional Features:
   - ⏳ File upload for documentation
   - ⏳ PDF report generation
   - ⏳ Assessment templates
   - ⏳ Auto-save functionality

## Project Organization

### Key Files
- `src/components/assessment/AssessmentForm.tsx` - Main assessment entry form
- `src/components/assessment/AssessmentEdit.tsx` - Edit existing assessments
- `src/types/assessment.ts` - Assessment-related type definitions
- `src/services/assessmentService.ts` - API integration for assessments

### Type Definitions
```typescript
export enum AssessmentType {
    INITIAL = 'INITIAL',
    FOLLOW_UP = 'FOLLOW_UP',
    DISCHARGE = 'DISCHARGE'
}

export interface AssessmentFormData {
    clientId: string;
    assessmentType: AssessmentType;
    // ... other fields
}
```

## Getting Started

1. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Check TypeScript Configuration:
   - Verify `tsconfig.json` baseUrl and paths
   - Ensure all required types are exported

3. Start Development Server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Known Issues
1. Import resolution for types and services
2. Type mismatch in AssessmentForm component
3. Path resolution in tsconfig.json needs verification

## Next Developer Tasks
1. Resolve import path issues
2. Fix type assignments in AssessmentForm
3. Complete AssessmentEdit component implementation
4. Add form validation
5. Implement service layer properly

## Technical Debt
- Need to add proper error boundaries
- Form validation needs to be more robust
- Type definitions could be more comprehensive
- Service layer needs error handling
- Need to add loading states
- Auto-save functionality should be considered
- File upload capabilities needed for documentation

## Notes for Next Developer
- The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Ensure you're using TypeScript strict mode
- Follow the existing component structure
- Use the common components in `/src/components/common`
- Add error handling for all API calls
- Consider adding unit tests as you implement new features

## Questions to Resolve
1. Should we add a service worker for offline capabilities?
2. How should we handle large assessment data?
3. Do we need to implement real-time updates?
4. What's the best way to handle file uploads?
5. Should we add a state management solution (Redux/MobX)?
